# Time-series modeling of parish survival trends
An Analytical Study of Financial & Ministerial Vitality 
Goal of the Capstone Project
In this Capstone Project, my goal is to develop a model to predict whether a church will be able to keep its door open in the long run based on their financial vitality, defined as the ability of a parish to maintain their financial operations and membership.  I will be looking at the publicly available parochial data from Episcopal parishes, coupled with Tapestry demographic datasets derived in part from U.S. census data. While this current model will be built based on the data of The Episcopal Church, my hope is that this can be applied to other types of religious organizations with some adjustments on a case by case basis. 
Prior to this project, the prediction of church survival was often done on an actuarial basis, without necessarily taken into consideration the multifaceted dynamics of church financial viability such as membership and neighborhood shifts. My model will take into consideration the financial and demographic data to predict the most likely outcome for a given church. In other words, will a church close or open? Even if a church predicted to close does not end up closing, the prediction is still helpful as a warning sign which can inform policies and planning.
